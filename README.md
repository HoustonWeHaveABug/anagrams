# anagrams
Create anagrams from a list of words or sentences.

Solution to challenge https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4zcly2/20160824_challenge_280_intermediate_anagram_maker/

The program takes 2 arguments:
- The path to the dictionary containing the words allowed in the anagrams
- The minimal length of words in the anagrams

The list of words or sentences is read from standard input (one per line)

For each word/sentence the program will display the first anagram found and the total number of solutions.
